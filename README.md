# VisulaSite
As of 7/2021, Visula is no longer publicly available.  The option to re-host it is still being considered, though.

Visula is a Django project that uses Whitenoise to serve its static pages.  All Python libraries are viewable in the requirements.txt and the only JavaScript library used is Chart.JS

The purpose of this project is to simplify the search for key information about stocks (year by year revenue, cash vs. debt, price momentum, etc.).  Visula makes the search simple and returns the data visually with graphs.
